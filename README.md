Task and Employee Manager is a Python-based application with a Tkinter GUI for managing tasks and employee information stored in a MySQL database.
It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them. For employees, users can add entries with ID and salary information, and display all employee records.
The database schema includes tables for tasks (id, task_name, completed) and employees (emp_id, salary).
To use the application, ensure Python and MySQL are installed, and install the mysql-connector-python library.
Run the Python script to start the application. Potential enhancements include adding user authentication, task prioritization features, and improving the GUI for better usability.
